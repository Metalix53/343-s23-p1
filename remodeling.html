    <h2>Remodeling</h2>
    <p>At Mancini Residential Construction, we are happy to remodel any part of your home that you wish. This includes: living rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, and bedrooms,
       as well as outside projects such as decks, porches, garages, and more. If you have a vision, we can bring it to life. Remodeling projects are completely in the hands of the client. You 
       pick the materials that you want, and we will worry about installing them. We will also never hesitate to let clients know if there are any potential conflicts with their choices, or if
       there are better options available.
