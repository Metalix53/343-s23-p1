    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Mancini Residential Construction is a family owned business operating in and around the Winchester Virginia
      area. We primarily specialize in home remodeling and new home construction. We have been building and remodeling for the last
      20 years and we take great pride in our work. If you have a vision for how you want a part of your home to look, we are happy
      to bring that vision to life. At Mancini Residential Construction, our pledge is to make the remodeling process as seamless and stress
      free as possible, which is why we do all of our remodeling work personally. We understand that having strangers in your home can be uncomfortable
      which is why we never bring any other individuals into your home except for our family. We hope that by the time your project is finished, you can think
      of us as more than just strangers.
