    <ul>
      <li>I have created 5 separate pages for this site, each of which have a specific purpose. The first three
          pages share the same layout but differ in content while the other two pages, the gallery and contact page, have their
          own distict layout. Index.html serves as the home page for this site.
      </li>
      <li>In order to have a favicon on this website I created a simple design in Google Drawings that reflects the
          theme of the site. The favicon is also the "logo" for the company and is displayed in the footer.
      </li>
      <li>The header of my site is an h1 that declares the company name at the very top, followed by a "header" element that
          also serves as the navigation links for the site. Each element of the header is the title of each page.
      </li>
      <li>The header is used as a navigation element in this site. There are also a few navigation links on the contact page.</li>
      <li>I have created three distict layouts for most pages, the last two pages only use 2 different layouts. The first
          three pages include a layout for desktop, a layout for half screens (either desktop or laptops/tablets), and a layout for 
          mobile phones. The last two include a desktop layout and a mobile layout. The main difference between layouts is that the
          desktop version favors row orientation while the mobile versions favor column orientation in order to fit as much information on the pages
          as possible. I decided to go with a desktop first design here since the audience of this site is homeowners who are generally in
          an older age demographic. It seems more likely to me that the majority of the audience would be most likely to access this page from
          a larger screen. Nevertheless, the site works well on all layouts.
      </li>
      <li>Four out of five pages on this site include images, and the gallery page is exclusively for images. The alt text for these
          images is descriptive and the gallery page also provides captions of the alt text.
      </li>
      <li>Validating my page on both the Nu Validator and WebAim WAVE revealed no errors in the final version of the site. 
          Originally, I had planned to use orange accents on the site since orange is often used for construction themes however the WAVE
          validator did not permit this, so I switched to a dark blue accent where accents were necessary.
      </li>
      <li>This site uses serif text for smaller text and sans-serif text for heading and navigation menus.</li>
      <li>There is a form included on the contact page that has a space for a user to enter their email and a description of a 
          project they would like done. The form doesn't do anything currently however it would presumably send information to an inbox
          where the company would be able to read through the request and respond to the client via email.
      </li>
      <li>On the contact page, I have included links to some company partners that clients should be able to view and potentially
          browse for ideas about their projects.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    In the final implementation, some minor changes were made to the layout as well as the change in accent colors to comply with the
    accesibility checker.
